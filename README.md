# Orbit Simulation

This is a simple orbit simulation program written in C++ using the SDL2 library. It simulates celestial bodies and their movement based on gravitational interactions.

## Features

- Visual representation of celestial bodies
- Random initialization of bodies' posiitons and velocities
- Customizable parameters for simulation

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- SDL2 library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ignabelitzky/orbit-simulation.git
    cd orbit-simulation
    ```

2. **Install SDL2**:

- On Ubuntu:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
    ```

- On macOS (using homebrew):

    ```bash
    brew install sdl2
    ```

- On windows, follow the instructions on the SDL2 website.

3. **Compile the program**:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

4. **Run the program**:

    ```bash
    ./main
    ```

## Usage

- The simulation will initialize a number of celestial bodies and display their movement in a window.
- You can close the window to exit the simulation.
